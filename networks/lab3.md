### Step 4:

1. 01 is the opcode used for request and 02 for reply.
2. It is 14 bytes large for both request and reply.
3. The value carried is 0.0.0.0 for the unknown MAC target.
4. The value that indicates ARP is 0x0806.
5. The reply is sent to a specific address, not 255.255.255.255; so it is not broadcast.

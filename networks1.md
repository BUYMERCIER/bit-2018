## Chapter 1: Introduction (1)

### Historic review:

* ENIAC: 1946 first computer

## Internetworking principles:

* minimalism and autonomy: no internal changes required to interconnect

* best effort service model: you just send message, no need to care if he's up or not or far ...

* stateless routers: internet = packet switching network, if damaged or down an other route will be taken (doesn't depend on node state)

* decentralized control

## History (again):

* 1983: deployment of TCP/IP

* 1982: smtp e-mail

* 1983: DNS (domain name translation)

* 1985: ftp 

* Early 1990's: HTML, HTTP (hypertext-transfeer-protocol), www (World Wide Web)

* 1990's-2000's: instant messaging, P2P, network security becomes important, backbonelinks

* 2007: ~500M hosts

## What is a computer network ? 

Computer network: Interconnected collection of autonomous computers

Our def: A system interconnectiong multiple autonomous computers in diifferent locations with communicaiton equipment, trunks, software ...

## Difference between network and distributed system

* Distributed = transparency, no info for users

* Network = new hosts, so users must choose a machine

* Difference is at the software level not hardware level

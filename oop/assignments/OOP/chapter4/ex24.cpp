// ex24.cpp
// Create a struct that holds an int and a pointer to another instance of the
// same struct. Write a function that takes the address of one of these structs
// and an int indicating the length of the list you want created. This function
// will make a whole chain of these structs (a linked list), starting from the
// argument (the head of the list), with each one pointing to the next. Make
// the new structs using new, and put the count (which object number this is)
// in the int. In the last structin the list, put a zero value in the pointer
// to indicate that itâ€™s the end. Write a second function that takes the head of
// your list and moves through to the end, printing out both the pointer value
// and the int value for each one.
